**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: Ibrahim Shilu

Time spent: 1.5 hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/first-resisted-helenium

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [*] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [*] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [*] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [*] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [*] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [*] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [*] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [*] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [*] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [*] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   Stack Overflow

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

A challenge I had in creating this submission was that I did not know javascript syntax and built in data structure and classes in order to do the functionality
of the game. I overcame this challenge by using my resources online in order to quickly look up the syntax for javascript so that I can spend most the time thinking
about the real math and logic behind the situation. Instead of worrying about how to write a for loop in javascript I just searched it up on Stack Overflow so that I
can worry about what the purpose of this for loop is and what I need to do within the for loop and how long it needs to go for. I did the same for implementing the
Math.random() method in Javascript. I spent a good amount of time thinking it was the same as the Java Math.random() method and putting the value in the parenthesis.
Once I remembered that JavaScript doesn't have a specific integer variables I searched the entirety of the Math class functions and found that I can use the Math.floor()
function in order to give me a integer in order to implement a random ordered sound queue.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

After completing this project, I have many questions about the use of web development. I am most curious about the back end programming of web development. Thinking about
how long this project was in the back end, it really makes me question how deep and in depth the back end programming must be for full webpages that we use on a daily basis.
It also makes me wonder how other languages such as python are implemented into a web development structure. For programs written in python do they have to be converted into
javascript to work on a web site or is there some sort of import for python or files, for example a web game.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would be most focused on creating a game that has different difficulties and can allow the user to choose the amount of clues that would be in pattern in total.
For the difficulty portion of the game if the user were to select the most difficult version to play it would play a different sequence between every turn.
Instead of progressively adding to a certain pattern I would have a different pattern sequence but with one more sound in the sequence each time, so it is more difficult to remember each turn. The easy version
would simply run the game as described by the project description. I would also have each button be the same color and several more buttons in order to make the game harder so that they do not remember by color.
